# Student Management Portal - Score Calculator

## Introduction

A modern and responsive **Student Score Calculator** built using React Functional Components and styled with clean, high-performance CSS. This application demonstrates the usage of functional components, state-less props communication, and pure mathematical rendering in React.

## How the Calculation Works

The score percentage is computed using pure JavaScript helper functions inside the `CalculateScore` component. Here is the operational logic:

1. **Calculate Fraction:**
   We compute the raw ratio of marks scored over the goal marks:
   $$\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Marks}}{\text{Goal Marks}}$$
   *Example: $\frac{284}{300} \approx 0.946667$*

2. **Convert to Percentage:**
   Multiply the ratio by 100, round the resulting number to 2 decimal places using `toFixed(2)`, and append the percentage `%` symbol.
   ```javascript
   const percentToDecimal = (decimal) => {
     return (decimal * 100).toFixed(2) + "%";
   };

   const calcScore = (total, goal) => {
     return percentToDecimal(total / goal);
   };
   ```
   *Example: $0.946667 \times 100 = 94.6667 \rightarrow \text{94.67}\%$*
