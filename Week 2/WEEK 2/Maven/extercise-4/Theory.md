## 📘 Maven Fundamentals

### 1. What is Maven?
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a Project Object Model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.

### 2. The POM (pom.xml)
The Project Object Model (POM) is the core unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It includes coordinates (groupId, artifactId, version), dependencies, and plugins.

### 3. Dependency Management
- **groupId**: Unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project (e.g. `com.library`).
- **artifactId**: Unique base name of the primary artifact being generated (e.g. `LibraryManagement`).
- **version**: The specific version of the generated artifact (e.g. `1.0-SNAPSHOT`).
- **packaging**: Defines the output format (e.g. `jar`, `war`, `pom`).

### 4. Maven Build Lifecycle
A build lifecycle is a well-defined sequence of phases. Standard lifecycles include:
- `clean`: Deletes the target directory to start fresh.
- `compile`: Compiles the source code of the project.
- `test`: Runs tests using suitable unit testing frameworks.
- `package`: Takes the compiled code and packages it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- `install`: Installs the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects.

## 📐 Dependency Analysis (Spring Core Modules)

This project requests three specific Spring dependencies configured for **Java 1.8**:
1. **Spring Context**: Extends the BeanFactory to add support for internationalization, event propagation, and resource-loading.
2. **Spring AOP**: Provides aspect-oriented programming implementation, allowing you to define method interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly decouple cross-cutting concerns.
3. **Spring WebMVC**: Provides the Model-View-Controller architecture and components for building robust web applications.

*Note*: Because Spring Framework 6.x requires a minimum of Java 17, we use the stable **Spring 5.3.37** version, which fully supports Java 8 (1.8).

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Common Errors

1. **`UnsupportedClassVersionError`**:
   - *Cause*: Compiling with a newer JDK version but attempting to run on an older JRE that does not support the target class file version.
   - *Solution*: Ensure the Maven compiler plugin configuration source and target match your installed runtime JDK (Java 1.8).
2. **`DependencyResolutionException`**:
   - *Cause*: Attempting to use a dependency version that does not exist in Maven Central, or network connectivity failures during dependency downloads.
   - *Solution*: Double-check Spring framework version mappings and internet proxy configurations.
